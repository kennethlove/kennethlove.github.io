## Testimonials
> Kenneth is immeasurably fantastic at meeting me at my position, skill, and bearing and providing directed and meaningful progression to my tasks, goals, and ideas. When I have lofty mile markers, I can easily discuss different approaches to get there, avoid hurdles, or discuss hypotheticals in a challenging dynamic programming environment. And then to top it off, I get the support for learning new approaches in a succinct and tailored meeting. I highly recommend them as a great resource to strengthen your skills.
