# Want to learn Python or Django?
I'm offering private 1:1 tutoring via video chat. It's available by the
hour, once per week per person. [Contact me](/social/) and we'll set up a time for a free, 10 minute consultation.

In no particular order, I’m happy to mentor you on any of the following topics:

* Django
* Django REST Framework
* Python
* Pytest
* Object-oriented programming
* Writing and releasing libraries and packages

I've been writing software in Python, mostly using the Django web framework, for over 15 years. I've been teaching Python and Django for over 10 years. I've taught thousands of students in person and online. I've spoken at conferences and meetups about Python and Django. I've been a technical reviewer for books and videos on Python and Django. I've written and contributed to open source projects, mostly for Django and the Django ecosystem. I even have code I wrote in the Django codebase, if that's impressive to you.

If there's a Python or Django topic you want to learn, I can help you learn it. If there's a topic you want to learn that's not on the list, let me know and we'll see if it's something I can help you with.

# Code Review

Have you built a project but you want to make sure you're following best practices? I can review your code and give you feedback on how to improve it. [Contact me](/social/) and we'll set up a time for an appointment. You'll send
me your code ahead of time, ideally, and we'll go over my feedback during our
appointment. I can provide some code changes as pull requests and all will be
in writing so you can refer back to it later.

I'm happy to sign an NDA if you need me to.

# Onboarding

Are you hiring new developers and want to get them into your codebase as
easily as possible? I can help you with that. [Contact me](/social/) and we'll
go over your current onboarding process and I'll give you feedback on how to
improve it for your new hires. I'll provide advice around first-day duties,
documentation you should have, team and project introductions, and more. I've been successfully onboarding engineers at O'Reilly for 5+ years with an excellent
track record. I'd love to help you have a more welcoming and empowering onboarding process!

# Testimonials
> Kenneth is immeasurably fantastic at meeting me at my position, skill, and bearing and providing directed and meaningful progression to my tasks, goals, and ideas. When I have lofty mile markers, I can easily discuss different approaches to get there, avoid hurdles, or discuss hypotheticals in a challenging dynamic programming environment. And then to top it off, I get the support for learning new approaches in a succinct and tailored meeting. I highly recommend them as a great resource to strengthen your skills.
> * Chris F.

> I understand concepts that I couldn’t fathom a year ago. I feel confidence in areas I never knew I had!
> * Alissa V.

> Kenneth is one of two people that I credit for helping me craft a career from nothing. They have a cogency to their teaching that only comes from a mastery of the subject material. (They’d likely refuse to be as confident in themselves — I promise you, I have never seen anyone wield Python like this before.)
>
> The amount of gratitude and respect I owe and have in their regard are limitless — you will undoubtedly be pleased with their tutoring help.
> * Dillon R.
