# Want to learn Python or Django?
I'm offering private 1:1 tutoring via video chat. It's available by the
hour, once per week per person. [Contact me](/social/) and we'll set up a time for a free, 10 minute consultation.

## Topics
In no particular order, I’m happy to mentor you on any of the following topics:

* Python
* Pytest
* Django
* Django REST Framework

I've been writing software in Python, mostly using the Django web framework for over 15 years. I've been teaching Python and Django for over 10 years. I've taught thousands of students in person and online. I've spoken at conferences and meetups about Python and Django. I've been a technical reviewer for books and videos on Python and Django. I've written and contributed to open source projects, mostly for Django and the Django ecosystem. I even have code I wrote in the Django codebase, if that's impressive to you.

If there's a Python or Django topic you want to learn, I can help you learn it. If there's a topic you want to learn that's not on the list, let me know and we'll see if it's something I can help you with.

## Testimonials
> Kenneth is immeasurably fantastic at meeting me at my position, skill, and bearing and providing directed and meaningful progression to my tasks, goals, and ideas. When I have lofty mile markers, I can easily discuss different approaches to get there, avoid hurdles, or discuss hypotheticals in a challenging dynamic programming environment. And then to top it off, I get the support for learning new approaches in a succinct and tailored meeting. I highly recommend them as a great resource to strengthen your skills.
