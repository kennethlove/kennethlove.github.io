# Overview

Heya! I'm Kenneth. I write [code for a living](https://oreilly.com). I used to [teach Python](https://teamtreehouse.com/kennethlove) as a job. I also [participate in open source](https://github.com/kennethlove). I also offer
[private mentoring](/mentoring/) and [code review](/code-review/). I do a lot of other things, too, but you're probably not here for them.

I've been a developer for well over a decade now. I've worked for [ecommerce sites](https://tindie.com), [design firms](https://bricksf.com), and did freelance development for a long time.  I have experience
setting up servers, using third-party services, building bots for various systems, and more. I also built a pretty popular [collection of mixins](https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces) for Django's class-based
views. Some of them even got [merged into Django itself](https://github.com/django/django/commit/e5cb4e14118f3a508e3bc00ee7cd50bb0f18a61d).

I'm also a frequent conference presenter and sometimes do programming live streams.

In the past, I've [helped organize workshops](https://djangogirls.org/portland/) and [conferences](https://djangocon.us). Basically, I have a lot of fingers and I like to keep them in pies.  That's such a weird phrase.
